# Error Blame: Eternal Fruit
<p>Error Blame: Eternal Fruit is a Google Translate mod for Bug Fables created by ShadeBlade and completed on October 28, 2020.</p>
<p>All of the dialogue (along with the title screen, action command text, and rank up text) has been translated through Google Translate through several languages, leading to a much more convoluted plot, strange characters, and new lore.</p>

The mod is in the errorblame.zip file, which has further instructions for installation.

The 10-30-20 and 11-05-20 versions are just previous versions of the mod, the ones uploaded to some discord servers.

The 10-30-20 version was made for Bug Fables version 1.0 and its the only one I fully tested on
The 11-05-20 version was made for Bug Fables version 1.1
