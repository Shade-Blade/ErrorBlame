This code was used to convert all the dialogue files to a form easier to use with Google Translate.
This game makes extensive use of tags, so they have to be preserved to make everything work.
Also, I wrote some code to find the differences between 1.0 dialogue and 1.1 dialogue.

I've removed references to the folders used as input and output, so you'll have to add them back to use this code (you would still have to change them anyway)
